            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome! This Privacy Policy describes how we use, share, and protect information that we collect from
                you and your through use of our applications. The main purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform the
                process and data protection policy to Flatshop App users. "Flatshop" application is the ready made
                complete solution for the single Woocommerce store application support both android and iOS.
            </p>

            <h3>How information is collected and How it is Used</h3>
            <p>
                Certain visitors to Flatshop's websites choose to interact with Flatshop in ways that require Flatshop
                to
                gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Flatshop gathers
                depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a demo at
                Flatshop to provide their name and email address for us to provide a demonstration of their app. Those
                who engage in transactions with Flatshop – by purchasing access to the Flatshop services, for example –
                are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial
                information required to process those transactions. In each case, Flatshop collects such information
                only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
                Flatshop. Flatshop does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
                And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it
                will prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities, like receiving a demo or
                purchasing any of our services.
            </p>

            <h3>Protection of Personally Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>
                FlatShop discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those
                of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in
                order to process it on FlatShop’s behalf or to provide services available at FlatShop’s websites, and (ii)
                that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
                organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using FlatShop’s websites, you consent to
                the transfer of such information to them. FlatShop will not rent or sell potentially
                personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,
                contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, FlatShop discloses potentially
                personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
                order or other governmental request, or when FlatShop believes in good faith that disclosure is
                reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of FlatShop, third parties or the public at large.

                example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it
                in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. FlatShop takes
                all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or
