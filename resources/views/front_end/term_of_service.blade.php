                conditions of
                this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not
                access the Website or use any services. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by

            <h3>Your Account and Mobile App</h3>
            <p>
                If you create an app on the Website, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account
                and app, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other
                actions taken in connection with the app. You must not describe or assign keywords to your app in a
                misleading or unlawful manner, including in a
                manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others, and FlatShop may change or remove any
                description or keyword that it considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to cause
                FlatShop liability. You must immediately notify FlatShop of any unauthorized uses of your app, your
                account or
                any other breaches of security. FlatShop will not be liable for any acts or omissions by You, including
                any
                damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. The applications created using the
                Services
                will have to meet rules of the relevant app stores and marketplaces and in particular Apple’s App Store
                and Google Play. FlatShop does not guarantee in any way
                that apps built using the Services will be approved for publication by any third party.
            </p>

            <h3>Responsibility of App users</h3>
            <p>
                FlatShop has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted
                to its customers’ apps, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects.
                FlatShop disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by users of the Website or
                apps, or from any downloading by those users of content there posted.
            </p>

            <h3>Termination</h3>
            <p>
                If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your FlatShop account (if you have one), you may simply
                contact FlatShop and request a cancellation of your account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided
                that, FlatShop can terminate the Website immediately as part of a general shut down of our service. All
                provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
                including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of
                liability.
            </p>

            <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
            <p>

                hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of
                FlatShop, or by the posting by FlatShop of a revised version. The Agreement shall be governed by,
                interpreted and construed in accordance with English law. The parties irrevocably agree that the courts
                of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of
                or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual
                disputes or claims) save that FlatShop has the express right (at its sole discretion) to bring an action
                against you in a court or courts where you are resident, have your principal place of business or
                central administration. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any
                breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach
                thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be
                bound by, its terms and conditions; FlatShop may assign its rights under this Agreement without
                condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their
                successors and permitted assigns.
